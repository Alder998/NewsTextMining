# Understanding Market Sentiment from Morning News
News Text Mining and NLP Algorithm

The Project aim is to understand the future return of many different stocks, applying Deep Learning on the morning news about the stocks themselves. Therefore, a large scraping algorithm surfs the web every morning, to find relevant news about a given company, and simoultaneously takes the return of the related share. Then, the text is pre-processed with different word embeddings, and analyzed with Neural Networks. The final scope is to create an engine to undestand the market sentiment, and recommend the most relevenat stocks to trade.
